# WebAP Browser Extension

This is a browser extension that implements the [WebAP API](https://github.com/webap-api/WebAP-API) (still an idea), exposing it to web applications.

It is currently in development, not yet in usable state.

The first release will be proof of concept, not ready for "productive" usage.

Until there is a reasonably stable data model and API, it it will remain with major version 0 and not committed for backwards compatibility.

## References

The initial state of the repository and tooling setup is largely based on [podStation](https://github.com/podStation/podStation/tree/4fc7de2bde3f6767fc31013965fdf13aab78c47c).

Many of the concepts were inspired or even copied from [Joule](https://lightningjoule.com/), which analogously implement the WebLN API.
