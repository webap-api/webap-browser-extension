# WebAP Browser Extension

This is a browser extension that implements the [WebAP API](https://github.com/webap-api/WebAP-API) (still an idea).

It is currently in development, not yet in usable state.

The first release will be proof of concept, not ready for "productive" usage.

Until there is a reasonably stable data model and API, it it will remain with major version 0 and not committed for backwards compatibility.
